            Introduction
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Your retirement funds, held by investment giants like Vanguard,
            State Street, and BlackRock, come with voting rights â€“ rights that
            these firms have effectively usurped. They wield immense influence
            over corporate policy and, by extension, our society, all because
            they control <em>our</em> proxy votes. This concentration of power
            allows them to make decisions that often prioritize their own
            interests over those of individual investors.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The complexity of proxy statements has historically been a barrier
            to individual participation. But now, with the advent of self-hosted
            Large Language Models (LLMs), we have the potential to reclaim that
            power. This tool is designed to demystify those complex documents,
            empowering you to understand and exercise your voting rights
            directly, from the security of your own self-hosted environment.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This is about more than just voting; it's about reclaiming our
            digital sovereignty and challenging the centralized control that has
            eroded our influence. It's about taking back <em>our</em> voice.

              For maximum control and privacy, we recommend deploying the proxy
              voting tool on your Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. This
              option allows you to keep your data completely within your own
              network.

              privacy and security practices.
