# The John Connor Project

## Overview & Ethos

The **John Connor Project** is inspired by the archetype of John Connor from the _Terminator_ franchise—a symbol of resistance, leadership, and strategic foresight in the face of AI-driven threats. This initiative is designed to shift the narrative surrounding cybersecurity, elevating IT professionals to a critical societal role akin to electricians, plumbers, and auto mechanics. The project emphasizes the importance of personal digital security and self-hosted technologies, empowering individuals to reclaim control over their data and online presence.
